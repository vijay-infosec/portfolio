        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Cybersecurity didn’t start for me as a hobby or a random interest. It became a discipline the moment I realised how much can hide behind systems that appear perfectly normal. Early on, I learned that digital behaviour is rarely random. Every pattern has a cause, every inconsistency has a story, and every small detail can expose something far larger if you know how to read it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The more I analysed events and behaviour, the faster I understood that threats do not announce themselves. They blend in. They mimic legitimacy. They rely on people not paying attention. That pushed me to look deeper, to question everything that felt slightly out of place, and to treat every anomaly like a thread worth pulling.
        </p>

        <p>
            Exploring the attacker’s perspective was a natural next step. I began recreating attacks in controlled environments, experimenting with exploitation techniques, and studying the mindset behind offensive strategies. Once you understand the intention behind an exploit, recognising early indicators becomes second nature. You stop reacting and start anticipating.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working with malware sharpened this mindset even further. While creating analysis labs for students, I watched harmless looking files unravel into aggressive behaviour the moment they were examined properly. It taught me not to trust anything based on appearance and to rely on behaviour, correlation, and proof.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over time, I began focusing on defence structures that do not just detect threats but understand them. Modelling irregular behaviour, analysing flow patterns, and building lightweight AI driven frameworks helped me create systems designed to expose inconsistencies before they escalate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, cybersecurity is not just something I enjoy. It is how I think. Whether I am dissecting a subtle pattern or building a smarter defensive mechanism, I approach every problem with the same mindset: stay curious, stay critical, and never accept surface level answers.
